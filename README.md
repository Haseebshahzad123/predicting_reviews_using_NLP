**Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Ulta Skincare Reviews**
</br>
**Project Goal**: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a given skincare product review from Ulta expresses positive or negative sentiment.
</br>
**Project Steps:**
</br>
**Data Collection and Exploration (Completed):**
</br>
You've already loaded a dataset of Ulta skincare reviews (Ulta Skincare Reviews.csv).
Perform further exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics (e.g., distribution of ratings, common words, etc.).
**Data Preprocessing (Partially Completed):**
</br>
Handle missing values (you've already removed rows with missing data using df.dropna()).
**Clean the text data:**
Remove special characters, punctuation, and HTML tags.
Convert text to lowercase.
Tokenize the text (you've started this with nltk.word_tokenize).
Remove stop words (you've downloaded stopwords from NLTK).
Perform stemming or lemmatization (you have the necessary libraries imported).
**Feature Engineering:**
</br>
Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features that machine learning models can understand.
Consider using techniques like:
Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer)
TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer - you've already imported this)
**Model Selection and Training:**
</br>
Choose appropriate machine learning models for sentiment analysis, such as:
Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB - imported)
Support Vector Machines (SVC - imported)
Random Forest (RandomForestClassifier - imported)
Decision Trees (DecisionTreeClassifier - imported)
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (train_test_split - imported).
Train the selected models on the training data.
**Model Evaluation and Optimization:**
</br>
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (sklearn.metrics - imported).
Fine-tune the models' hyperparameters to improve their performance.
Deployment and Visualization (Optional):
</br>
**Consider deploying your model as a simple web application or API for others to use.
Visualize the results using graphs and charts to communicate insights effectively.**
